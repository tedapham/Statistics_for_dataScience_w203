# Introduction

This is a group lab.  You may work in teams of 2 or 3.

The file bwght\_w203.RData contains data from the National Center for Health Statistics and from birth certificates.  Your team has been hired by a health advocacy group to study this data and help them understand whether prenatal care improves health outcomes for newborn infants.

The file includes a birthweight variable.  Additonally, the one- and five-minute APGAR scores are included.  These are measures of the well being of infants just after birth.

Variable descriptions are provided as follows.

# Assignment

Prepare a report addressing the question of whether prenatal care improves newborn health outcomes.

A successful submission will include

1. A brief introduction

2. A model building process, supported by exploratory analysis.  Your EDA should be interspersed with, and support, your modeling decisions.  In particular, you should use exploratory techniques to address

- What transformations to apply to variables and what new variables should be created.

- What variables should be included in each model

- Whether model assumptions are met

3. A minimum of three model specifications.  In particular, you should include

- One model with only the explanatory variables of key interest.

- One model that includes only covariates that you believe increase the accuracy of your results without introducing bias.

- One model that includes the previous covariates, but also covariates that may be problematic for one reason or another.

4. For your first model, a detailed assessment of the 6 CLM assumptions.  For additional models, you should check all assumptions, but only highlight major differences from your first model in your report.

5. A well-formatted regression table summarizing your model results.  Make sure that standard errors presented in this table are valid.  Also be sure to comment on both statistical and practical significance.

6. A discussion of whether your results can be interpretted causally.  In particular, include a discussion of what variables are not included in your analysis and the likely direction of omitted variable bias.  Also include a discussion of which included variables may bias your results by absorbing some of the causal effect of prenatal care.

7. A brief conclusion with a few high-level takeaways.


Please limit all submissions to 30 pages.  Be sure to turn in both your pdf report and also your source code.
